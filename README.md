Question 1: What is the best value for k in our original scaled data?
Answer 1: The best value for k in our original scaled data is 4.

Question 2: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components in our PCA?
Answer 2: The total explained variance of the three principal components in our PCA is  89.50%.

Question 3: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?
The best value for k when using the PCA data is 4.

Question 4: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
Answer 4: No, it does not differ from the best k value found using the original data. Both are 4. However, there is a difference in inertia value. For a k value of 4, the inertia for PCA is lower, indicating more compact clusters.

Question 5: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
Answer 5: Using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means, as seen with PCA, results in more clearly defined and separated clusters compared to the original data. This leads to improved cluster analysis and predictive accuracy.
